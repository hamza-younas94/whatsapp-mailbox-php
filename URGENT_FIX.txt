🔥 URGENT FIX - DO THESE EXACT STEPS NOW

Your Namecheap server needs these 4 commands:

1. SSH to your server
2. Run these commands ONE BY ONE:

cd public_html
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
php init_crm_data.php

3. Then in your browser:
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)
   - Select "Cached images and files"  
   - Click "Clear data"
   - Go to: whatsapp.nexofydigital.com/index.php
   
4. If STILL not working, open browser Console (F12) and paste this:

localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload(true);

THAT'S IT. After these steps you WILL see:
- Green gradient navigation bar
- Stage badges on contacts
- Lead scores in circles  
- Modern styling everywhere

The problem: Your server has OLD files. The git reset --hard will FORCE update everything.
